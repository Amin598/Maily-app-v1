## ðŸŽ¯ Startup Coding Principles

**EARLY-STAGE STARTUP RULES - FOLLOW THESE:**

1. **Prioritize simple, readable code with minimal abstraction** - avoid premature optimization. Strive for elegant, minimal solutions that reduce complexity. Focus on clear implementation that's easy to understand and iterate on as the product evolves.

2. **DO NOT preserve backward compatibility** unless the user specifically requests it. Move fast and break things that need breaking.
